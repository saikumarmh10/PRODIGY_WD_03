# ⭕ Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe - Task 03

A sophisticated, browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed as part of the **ProDigy Infotech Web Development Internship**. This project demonstrates advanced state management, AI logic, and modern frontend styling techniques.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Dual Game Modes:** Switch seamlessly between Player vs. Player (PvP) and Player vs. Computer (AI).
- **Intelligent State Tracking:** Centralized JavaScript logic to handle 8 winning combinations and draw detection.
- **Glassmorphism Design:** A modern UI utilizing `backdrop-filter` blur, floating gradient circles, and neon text-shadows.
- **Dynamic Feedback:** Real-time turn indicators and a celebratory win overlay.
- **Fully Responsive:** Playable on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **HTML5:** Semantic grid structure for the 3x3 game board.
- **CSS3:** Custom properties (Variables), advanced animations (`keyframes`), and Flexbox/Grid layouts.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** - **Modular Pattern:** The game is wrapped in a self-invoking function to prevent global scope pollution.
  - **Logic:** Implemented a non-linear winning condition algorithm based on index-pattern matching.
